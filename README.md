This is a URL shortener with the following functionality:

I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.

The app can be found on Glitch [here](https://url--shortener.glitch.me/);
